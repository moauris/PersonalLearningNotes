- [ ] Fast WPF Delivery Practice Set (FWD-PRACS) depository creating and initialization 
- [ ] Populate FWD-PRACS with first Topic: Validation Rules
- [ ] Commit to JavaScript Learning depository

# Topic 1: Introducing FWD-PRACS

## Summary

FWD-PRACS stands for <span style="background:grey;color:white;"> Fast WPF Delivery Practice SetÂ </span>. It is a personal depository of original examples derived from Microsoft WPF Samples on various topics.

- **Originality**: the Microsoft samples can be referenced, but the projects should be original on their own.
- **Fast Delivery**: The project and guidelines should focus on efficiency of the implementations.
- **Quantity versus Quality**: The plan is to have a README.md file included in each solution with clear goals for the functionalities the app is trying to achieve.

## Problem

- [x] #1 Create Multiple projects under one solution.
- [ ] #2 How to write a Project README.md

## Solution

To create multiple projects, choose add to existing project option from the VS create solution menu. #1



## Extra

A solution can have multiple projects. In case of projects get out of hand, use the contextual menu for "scope to this" and leave just one project in the focus. Navigate back to exit the scoped solution explorer.

# Topic 3: Commit to JavaScript Learning depository

## Summary

Today is the second day of JavaScript learning! Checked out some basic stuff on JavaScript, doesn't look extremely challenging (compared to C#).

The goal is to ultimately learn how to use TypeScript. I know from the books that TypeScript is supposed to make JavaScript Type safe in compile time, therefore the wiser option should be to start with TypeScript, I still feel like going from bottom to top is a better way for me personally.

Of course come with JavaScript is the inevitable HTML and CSS. If you think about it the JavaScript - HTML - CSS is a little bit like the WPF's window.xaml.cs - window.xaml - app.xaml(app.resources), the difference is in that JS, HTML, CSS is web technology, while WPF is for Microsoft.NET.
