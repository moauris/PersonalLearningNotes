A library for all personal learning notes.

## Learning Programming Generic Skills:

### Markdown

Markdown helps with creating readme file, opening issues on GitHub, and most importantly: creating notes itself.

### Text editor: vi/vim

Text editor vi and vim helps creating GitHub commits.

### Regular Expression

Regex is an important syntax that helps with text matching. It is used extensively in most programming languages and console shells.

### Structure Query Language

There are many Database tools out there. Based on work experience, the one that I am most familiar with is PostgreSQL.

### Git and GitHub

General knowledge and skills on how to use Git and GitHub.

## Learning Programming Languages:

### C#

I learning C# because of the Microsoft.Net Framework has indigenous and built-in compilation tools even in working environment with strict user controls where installing SDKs to code in Java or Python is not allowed.

I have built many command line tools in C# to help automatize workflow, even when installation in strictly controlled windows environment is forbidden.

### Windows Presentation Foundations

WPF is the desktop application development foundation for C#. It can create desktop applications with real opacity and advanced shape rendering.

### PowerShell Scripting

Like C#, PowerShell is a part of the Microsoft.Net Framework. To further strengthen the skills in PowerShell Scripting helps with faster delivery and code analysis.

## Language Learning Wishlist:

### JavaScript

JavaScript can be used to develop Microsoft Office Extensions. It can also be used to create interactive logic for HTML forms. If in WPF, the XAML file renders the UI and the XAML.CS file creates the interactive logic, the HTML would be the XAML and JavaScript would be the C# source code.
